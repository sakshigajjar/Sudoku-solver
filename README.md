# Sudoku-solver
This GitHub repository hosts a C++ implementation of a Sudoku game solver using the popular backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a classic logic-based number placement puzzle that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, with the constraint that each digit must appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
